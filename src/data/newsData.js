        link: "",
        article: "I am on week two of building out this site.  It's been fun and little challenging and I'm trying to not get sidetracked by thinking of the upcoming obstacles I am going to be running into eventually, but I can't seem to help it.  I've had alot of days off from working on it from being sick from Covid, so I have had plenty of time to think about the obstacles.  One of my biggest concerns though is how to finish a complete database/catalog to all of polaroid's film framees.  Do I just include Polaroid film and film frames, or do I include ALL OF IT, like from before Polaroid went bankrupt, when The Impossible Project took over, when it came Polaroid Originals, and then to current?  Alot of the information on the film and film frame types are scattered all over the internet.  I mean, that's kind of the sole reason I am developing this site, to have a centeralized location/hub for this information.  The most logical solution to my worry of having a complete database, would be to involve the community.  Complete it as much as possible on my own, and with help from users and the community, build upon that.  It's not just for me.  It's for ya'll too.",

I will be deploying the app on Friday on doing some private test on the app to make sure it looks alright on mobiles devices.  The plan really is to just get it to the point where users can navigate and check it out.  Some features MAY be on he chopping bored, but I will elaborate more on what's staying on this site and whats to come.  I have alot of big plans for instantMania and I am very excited to be working on this and also very nervous.  I just want to do a good job and provide a great service for this community that I care so much about.",

It isn't perfect, but it is working.  If you have the link to the site and have been messing around on the instant film page, you'll notice some of the film you can read more details about it.  This is still a work in progress section (along with all the other areas on the app) but I'm glad to finally get something up instead of pondering on how to do it.",

        article: "I have just rolled out a game-changing update that promises to revolutionize the way you use the app. With the new search bar functionality, finding your desired Polaroid film frames and text types has never been easier or more convenient. This innovative feature is set to enhance the user experience, making navigation through the app faster and more intuitive. Some key highlights of the new search bar functionality are: 1. Effortless Search: The search bar makes it effortless to find specific Polaroid film frames and types. Just type in your keywords, and the app will instantly present you with a curated selection. 2. Time-Saving: No more endless scrolling or browsing through numerous options. The search bar function is designed to save your valuable time.  Implementing this new feature was a challenge to implement but later, I plan to make it more robust and responsive adding in more additional features.",

        article: "I have had plans to update the site's navigation bar to include links to film pages, alongside the existing cards. Additionally, there are plans to replace all photos on the website with ones photographed and curated by me. This marks a significant step towards revamping the user experience and enriching the website's content. While there are exciting developments in the pipeline, the website is not stopping here. Plans are underway to introduce gallery pages, which will feature captivating collections of photos, art, and more. This step will further diversify the website's content and engage users with various forms of instant photography art. With the evolving landscape of web development, I am taking steps to enhance my technical skills by learning how to implement a backend system for the website. This knowledge will allow for more interactive and dynamic features, keeping the website up-to-date with the latest web development trends. In conclusion, InstantMania is undergoing a transformation that promises a more enriching experience for its users. With film pages joining the navigation bar, the introduction of curated images, the upcoming gallery pages, and an investment in backend development, visitors can look forward to an exciting and dynamic online environment. These changes reflect a commitment to staying current in the digital world and ensuring the website's continued success. Stay tuned for more updates as these exciting changes unfold!",
