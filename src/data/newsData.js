        article: "I am on week two of building out this site.  It's been fun and little challenging and I'm trying to not get sidetracked by thinking of the upcoming obstacles I am going to be running into eventually, but I can't seem to help it.  I've had alot of days off from working on it from being sick from Covid, so I have had plenty of time to think about the obstacles.  One of my biggest concerns though is how to finish a complete database/catalog to all of polaroid's film framees.  Do I just include Polaroid film and film frames, or do I include ALL OF IT, like from before Polaroid went bankrupt, when The Impossible Project took over, when it came Polaroid Originals, and then to current?  Alot of the information on the film and film frame types are scattered all over the internet.  I mean, that's kind of the sole reason I am developing this site, to have a centeralized location/hub for this information.  The most logical solution to my worry of having a complete database, would be to involve the community.  Complete it as much as possible on my own, and with help from users and the community, build upon that.  It's not just for me.  It's for ya'll too.",
