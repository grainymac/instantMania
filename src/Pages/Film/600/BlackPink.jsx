                        This pack of Duochrome Pink & Black 600 Instant Film from Polaroid Originals contains eight sheets of film for use with Polaroid 600-series cameras. Producing unique two-tone images, this special ISO 640 duochrome film offers a dusky magenta and rich black tonal scale for a dramatic appearance. The overall rose-colored mood is complemented by a matte black frame surrounding the 3.1 x 3.1" glossy image area. Each shot develops in 5-10 minutes after exposure, and the film should be stored in a cool, refrigerated, but not frozen, place before use. Additionally, even though this film features a built-in a battery to power 600-series cameras, it can also be used with i-Type cameras that feature their own camera battery.
